# Media Analytics Pipeline

## Overview

This project analyzes a year of social media campaign data from four sources to visualize trends, compare device performance, and provide key insights into Metaâ€™s weekly campaigns and their duration. The solution implements a modular and automated pipeline that processes campaign performance data, generating visual reports on metrics like impressions, clicks, and views. These reports are generated using standalone Python scripts and saved locally for easy access and analysis.

## Features

- **Campaign Performance Analysis:** Analyze data from four sources across various devices.
- **Meta Weekly Campaign Analysis:** Visualize and compare impressions for campaigns, accounting for duration and partial weeks.
- **Interactive Reports:** Reports are rendered as browser-viewable HTML files using Plotly.
- **Local Output Storage:** Generated reports are saved in the `output/` folder on your machine.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrJohn91/platform_campaign_analysis
cd platform_campaign_analysis
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Pipeline

Run the main analytics script to generate all reports:

```bash
python media_analytics_pipeline.py
```

This will process the cleaned input data and generate HTML reports, saved in the `output/` directory.

### Available Reports

The following reports are generated by the pipeline:

* `CTR_by_Platform.html`
* `Impressions_Over_Time_by_Platform.html`
* `Total_Impressions_by_Platform.html`
* `Video_Completion_Metrics_by_Platform.html`
* `Video_Completions_by_Device_Type_and_Platform.html`
* `Meta_Weekly_Impressions.html`
* `Weekly_Impressions_by_Campaign_Duration.html`

All reports are saved as interactive Plotly HTML files and can be opened directly in a web browser.

## Directory Structure

* `data/`: Directory for input data files plus clean processed files for analysis.
* `output/`: Directory where generated reports will be saved.
* `media_analytics_pipeline.py`: Script for the analytics pipeline.
* `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
